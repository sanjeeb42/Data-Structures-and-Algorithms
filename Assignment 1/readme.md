3. Let us assume that A is a single dimensional array. You have given A array to construct a two-<br>
dimensional array. Write a C program to convert explicitly from 2D array to 1D array. Example,<br>

Map(A, i, j) gives you A[i][j]. You can use either row-major order or column-major order.<br>
4. Write a C program to benchmark the performance of Selection Sort and Bubble Sort. Total input<br>

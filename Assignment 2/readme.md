  Since ancient times, the ability to represent numbers and perform arithmetic operations on numbers <br>
<br>
played an important role. Hence, it is interesting to study how different representation formats 
<br>
impact the number representation and operations. In this experiment, we study the efficacy of 
<br>
various number representation formats. The central message of this experiment is to appreciate that 
<br>
something that is as common as operating on numbers has an embedded data structure lesson. In 
<br>
this experiment, we will first understand how operations such as addition and multiplication can be 
<br>
done in various formats. We focus on four formats: unary, binary, decimal, and Roman. In each of 
<br>
these four representation formats, we will learn how to perform the above two operations. You can 
<br>
look at the lecture notes, browse through slides, and also see an animation that can run several 
<br>
examples. 
<br>
1. The Hindu/Arabic System : This is also known as the decimal system and is presently in 
<br>
vogue in written communication. The system used 10 digits 0, 1, 2, , 9. For instance three ⋯, 9. For instance three<br> 
hundred and sixty seven is written as 367. This is a positional number system with the right 
<br>
most position having a weight of 1, the next position a weight of 10, and so on. 
<br>
2. The Roman System : This is a system using the symbols I, V, X, L, C, and M. This is not a 
<br>
positional system. As an example, 24 is written as XXIV. 
<br>
3. The Unary and the Binary System : In the former, the only symbol used is I and a number is 
<br>
represented by writing a number of I´s equal to its value. For example, 7 is written as IIIIIII. 
<br>
It can be noticed that this system is too laborious for large numbers such as those beyond 20 
<br>
or so.In the latter, two symbols 0 and 1 are used. This is a positional system with weights of 
<br>
1, 2, 4, and so on. For instance, 55 is written as 110111. The latter is popular because of its 
<br>
use in the present generation computers.  <br>
